# 0 build on mac first

build the binary on mac 

```sh
yarn
```

# 1 build and run the docker image

```sh
docker run \
  --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)"/libpg_query,target=/pg_query \
  --rm -it \
  $(docker build -q --file docker/Dockerfile .)
```

# build inside the docker image

```sh
branch=13-latest
mkdir git_clone_dir && cd git_clone_dir
git clone -b $branch --single-branch https://github.com/launchql/libpg-query-node
cd libpg-query-node/
yarn

# get the linux version and sent it to docker host
cp ./libpg_query/linux/libpg_query.a /pg_query/linux/
```

Now on the docker host machine, you should be able to publish:

```sh
npm publish
```

# building libpg_query

to build manually using `libpg_query`

```sh
branch=13-latest
mkdir git_clone_dir && cd git_clone_dir
git clone -b $branch --single-branch https://github.com/pganalyze/libpg_query.git
cd libpg_query/
make
cp libpg_query.a /pg_query/linux/
```
 
you should see `.a` files now :)

```
libpg_query/osx
libpg_query/osx/libpg_query.a
libpg_query/osx/.gitkeep
libpg_query/include
libpg_query/include/.gitkeep
libpg_query/include/pg_query.h
libpg_query/linux
libpg_query/linux/libpg_query.a
libpg_query/linux/.gitkeep
libpg_query/windows
libpg_query/windows/.gitkeep
```

make sure you grab the `pg_query.h` if you don't have it ;)
